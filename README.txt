Task description:

The task is to write a program which finds all anagrams of a given word in a
dictionary (the anagram must also be part of the dictionary).
The dictionary is a simple text file which contains one word per line. The program
should handle anagram-requests as fast as possible. Consider a pre-processing
of the dictionary to optimize the requests.


***

To run program, type: node run.js in your terminal.
Follow prompts on terminal to achieve desired results.

***

To run tests, make sure you are in the correct folder in your terminal (Anagram.Instructions) & type: 
    - npm i (installing packages from package.json)
    - npm test (initializing tests in test folder )
